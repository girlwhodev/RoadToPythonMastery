# 🐍 Day 1 of 100 Days of Python Challenge

## 📅 Date: [23/10/2025]

### 💬 My Goal
Start my 100 Days of Python journey by learning the basics — Linux commands, writing my first Python script, understanding Markdown (`.md`), and uploading my first project to GitHub.

---

## 🐧 Step 1: Learning Basic Linux Commands

Today, I practiced some basic Linux commands to navigate and manage files.

| Command | What It Does |
|----------|---------------|
| `mkdir folder_name` | Creates a new folder or directory |
| `ls` | Lists files and folders in the current directory |
| `ls -a` | Lists all files (including hidden ones) |
| `ls -la` | Lists all files with detailed info |
| `cd folder_name` | Changes directory |
| `touch file_name` | Creates a new file |
| `rm file_name` | Deletes a file |
| `rm -rf folder_name` | Deletes a folder (and everything in it) |
| `rm -rf *` | ⚠️ Deletes everything in the current folder (use carefully!) |
| `cat file_name` | Views the contents of a file |

📝 *Learning these helped me understand how to move around and manage files from the terminal.*

## 🐍 Step 2: My First Python Script

I created my first Python file using:

```bash
touch hello.py
````

Then I wrote my very first script:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

To run it:

```bash
python3 hello.py
```

🎉 *Seeing “Hello, World!” appear in the terminal felt amazing — my first line of Python code!*

## 🧠 Step 3: Learning About `.md` Files

Today I also learned what a `.md` (Markdown) file is.

* `.md` stands for **Markdown**
* It’s used for **documentation**
* You can add **headings**, **bold text**, **lists**, and **code blocks** easily

Example:

```markdown
# Heading
**Bold text**
*Italic text*
```

🧩 *Markdown makes writing clean and readable documentation fun and easy.*

## 🧰 Step 4: My First Git & GitHub Upload

I learned how to initialize Git and push my first code to GitHub:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "My first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
git push -u origin main
```

🚀 *I officially uploaded my first project to GitHub today!*

## 🧭 Reflections

* Learned how to use basic Linux commands
* Created my first Python script
* Learned what Markdown is and created this README.md file
* Uploaded my first project to GitHub

---

## 🏁 Summary

✅ Basic Linux Commands
✅ First Python Script
✅ Markdown Basics
✅ Git & GitHub Setup

### 💡 Next Step (Day 2 Preview)

Tomorrow I’ll start exploring **Python variables, data types, and user input**.
